If you wish to use other libraries than the ones provided in `lib/` directory
(e.g. package maintainers may want this) you can specify classpaths to
individual libraries in file `lib/nblibraries.properties`. Variables ending
with `.classpath` will be of interest to you.


Compiling program
-----------------

In sources root directory (where `build.xml` is located) run this command:

```
$ ant clean jar
```

If you want to build the program without Mac OS support (for example Linux
package maintainers not willing to use Apple library), use command:

```
$ ant -DnoMac=true clean jar
```

All the sources should be compiled in the `build/` directory. In the `dist/`
directory the resulting `esmska.jar` should be created, together with all needed
libraries, available gateways and some additional files copied from `include/`
directory.


Running program
---------------

After compiling you can run Esmska by command:

```
$ ./dist/esmska.sh
```

or

```
$ ant run
```

from the sources root directory.


Packaging program
-----------------

You can run command:

```
$ ./scripts/create-package VERSION
```

to obtain binary program packages (multiplatform and Windows) inside the program
root directory.

Mac packages can be created only on Mac OS by running this command:

```
$ ant -f build-mac.xml
```

When creating custom packages it may be good to note that the only important
files for the program are `esmska.jar`, `esmska.conf`, `lib/` and `gateways/`
directory. All other files are intended only for the end-user and the program
does not use them.

Package maintainer should be interested in `resources/` directory. It contains
many files useful for making packages. Especially an always up-to-date
`esmska.desktop` file should be used, because it contains localized menu item
translations.

You should also see the `esmska.conf` file, which is a system-wide configuration
file. You can set some default configuration there (like turning off update
notification for example, when you are distributing program through linux
repositories).


Working with translations
-------------------------

Program uses `src/esmska/resources/l10n*.properties` files for localization.
There are gettext files in the `po/` directory for simplifying user contributions.
By running command:

```
$ ./scripts/update-translations
```

a new `po/esmska.pot` template is generated, all PO message catalogs are updated
and localized properties files are generated from them.
