#If you want to use single quotes (') in this translation, you must write them doubled ('')!

GatewayProblem.LIMIT_REACHED.help=The gateway either requires a certain interval you need to wait before sending subsequent message, or it limits the number of messages that can be sent in a certain timeperiod. The rules are probably described on the gateway website <a href="{0}">{0}</a>.
GatewayProblem.LONG_TEXT.help=For standard-sized SMS (circa 160 characters) you need touse only basic characters primarily from the English alphabet. Using national characters (with diacritical marks, etc.) from other languages shortens the maximum SMS length to about 70 characters. This error message may be related to this problem.<br>\nIf it is possible in your language try not to use national characters and use pure English alphabet instead. In the program settings you can also enable/disable automatic message text conversion into this character set (works only for some languages).
